# Raw Idea: Move Validation Engine

**Source**: GitGammon Product Roadmap Item #4

## Feature Description

Move Validation Engine — Implement core backgammon rules: legal piece movement, hitting blots, bearing off conditions, and blocked point detection. Reject invalid moves with clear error messages.

## Context

## Key Requirements (from roadmap)

- Legal piece movement validation
- Hitting blots detection and rules
- Bearing off conditions enforcement
- Blocked point detection
- Clear error messages for invalid moves

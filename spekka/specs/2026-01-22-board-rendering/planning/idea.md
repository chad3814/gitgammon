# Board Rendering - Raw Idea

**Feature**: Board Rendering

**Description**: Build a static HTML/CSS/JS page that reads `state.json` and renders an interactive backgammon board on GitHub Pages. Support for all 24 points, bar, and bear-off areas using SVG.

**Context**: This is roadmap item #2 for GitGammon - a backgammon game played on GitHub Pages through commits.

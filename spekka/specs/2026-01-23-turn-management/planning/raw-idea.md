# Turn Management - Raw Idea

**Feature ID**: Roadmap Item #10
**Created**: 2026-01-23
**Status**: Planning

## Description

Turn Management feature for GitGammon that implements turn alternation between white and black players, handles blocked situations where a player has no legal moves (auto-pass), manages roll/move phase transitions (player rolls, then moves), and validates it's the correct player's turn in the GitHub Action workflow.

## Core Requirements (from Roadmap)

- Implement turn alternation between players
- Handle blocked situations (no legal moves available)
- Manage roll/move phase transitions
- Validate correct player's turn in the GitHub Action
- Priority: Standard (S)

## Key Components

1. **Turn Alternation**: White and black players take turns
2. **Blocked Situations**: Auto-pass when player has no legal moves
3. **Phase Transitions**: Roll phase → Move phase → Next player's turn
4. **Turn Validation**: GitHub Action validates it's the correct player's turn
